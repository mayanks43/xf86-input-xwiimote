This package includes an X.Org input driver for Nintendo Wii Remotes. It is
based on the xwiimote packages available at http://github.com/dvdhrm/xwiimote.

However, for this driver you don't need to install libxwiimote.
It's included along with xinput driver.

To install this driver use:

	./waf build
	sudo ./waf install

Please also copy the configuration file, otherwise the driver won't get loaded:

This driver is a fork of https://github.com/dvdhrm/xf86-input-xwiimote. It has been modified to include IR pointing capabilties. For
license information see ./COPYING.
